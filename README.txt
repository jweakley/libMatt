MattLib: Matt's General-Purpose Toolbox

This class library is a collection of helpful classes and utilities that I find myself frequently using in various projects. All code here is under the MIT license (see LICENSE), with the exception of the BCrypt library by Damien Miller and Derek Slager, which is licensed under similarly permissive terms (see Security/BCrypt.cs).
